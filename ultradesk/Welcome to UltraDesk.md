# Welcome to UltraDesk

Welcome to YPCloud! 
First, we need to create our own working space.

Telegram

1. Make sure you have joined these YPCloud groups on Telegram already:
* clockin://c20
* ioc://c20
* duty://c20
* jboard://c20
2. Add two chatbots to contacts:
* @JujueBot
* @PinponboyBot


Gitwork

* Make a Gitwork account: 
1. Head to gitwork.ypcloud.com, click Register, create a new account, and sign in.
2. Have someone add you as a Maintainer to the group "clouder-20"
3. Create your personal folder by clicking New Project, and name it "c20-Name".
4. In your c20 folder, make your progress journal by clicking "+" to add a new file, and name it "c20-name-雲耕日誌.md"
* Remember to update your progress regularly.
* Your code and other resources you develop at YPCloud, will be stored in Gitwork.


Flow365

1. Make a Jujue account:
* Head to account.ypcloud.com, click on Sign Up, and create a new username and password, then sign in.
2. Now, we need to create a clock-in twin bot with fBuilder:
* Use your Jujue account to sign in flow365.ypcloud.com.
* Create a simple flow that clocks-in to the Telegram channel clockin://c20 four times a day: at 9:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 00:00.


jBuilder

* Use your Jujue account to sign in jbuilder.ypcloud.com.
* Now you can use jBuilder to create your own jBoard!
