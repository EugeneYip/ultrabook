1. Make sure you have joined these YPCloud groups on Telegram already:
* clockin://c20
* ioc://c20

2. Add two chatbots to contacts:
* @JujueBot
* @PinponboyBot

## Jujue Account
1. Make a Jujue account:
* Head to account.ypcloud.com, click on Sign Up, and create a new username and password, then sign in.
* You can also choose to sing up with your gmail/facebook/telegram if you want.
2. Head to [Jujue Browser](https://jujue.app/browser), click the button on the top right side(App Launcher), now you can use your account to reach to gitwork,fbuilder,jbuilder etc.
