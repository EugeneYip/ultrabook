# Welcome to UltraDesk

Welcome to YPCloud! 
First, we need to create our own working space.

Telegram

1. Make sure you have joined these YPCloud groups on Telegram already:
* clockin://c21
* ioc://c21
* duty://c21
* jboard://c21
2. Add two chatbots to contacts:
* @JujueBot
* @PinponboyBot

## Jujue Account
1. Make a Jujue account:
* Head to [account.ypcloud.com](https://account.ypcloud.com/#/login), click on Sign Up and create a new username and password. Then sign in to confirm your new account.
* You can also choose to sign up with your Gmail/Facebook/Telegram if you want.
2. Head to [Jujue Browser](https://jujue.app/browser), click the App Launcher button on the top right corner. Now you can use your account to access Gitwork,fBuilder,jBuilder etc.

### Gitwork

* Remember to update your progress regularly.
* Your code and other resources you develop at YPCloud, will be stored in Gitwork.

### fBuilder

1. Sign in your Jujue account.
2. Now, we need to create a clock-in twin bot with fBuilder:
* Create a simple flow that clocks-in to the Telegram channel clockin://c21 four times a day: at 9:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 00:00.


### jBuilder
