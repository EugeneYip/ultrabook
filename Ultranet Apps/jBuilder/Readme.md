## What is a jBoard
With jBuilder you can create jBoards that can be used as digital display boards or digital dashboards.

A jBoard consists of a series of individual boards combined on a dock menu, each having their own dock page. 

You can navigate between dock pages from the dock menu at the bottom of a jBoard.

## jBuilder and Dock Builder
There are two main work areas involved in jBuilder. <br>
In the default jBuilder work area you create individual boards, then move on to the Dock Builder work area to combine a series of boards to create a complete jBoard.

### How to access Dock Builder: 
From the default jBuilder work area, click on the <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BwmKrTz.png" width=33 height=30> icon on the top left corner to go to Dock Builder. <br>
To leave Dock Builder and return to jBuilder, click the <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HopFYkU.png" width=35 height=30> icon.

On the left hand side <img src="https://i.imgur.com/66dK5wO.png" width=30 height=30> sidebar, the user can define the board grid by specifying the number of columns and rows, as well as enable/disable the header and footer of the board frame. 
The board grid serves as the framework for the boardâ€™s layout and helps us manage the proportions between elements for responsive web design. 

Next to this on the top tool bar, is <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BwmKrTz.png" width=33 height=30> which leads to Dock Builder. 

The icons at the right of the top tool bar have the following functions:
* Save board <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TJUZUG1.png" width=35 height=30>
* Add new panel <img src="https://i.imgur.com/J4a1Laa.png" width=30 height=30>
