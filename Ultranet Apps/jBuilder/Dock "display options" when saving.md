### Dock Display Options When Saving
When naming and saving your Dock in Dock Builder, you can also select whether or not to have a QRCode, Tools shortcut menu, and Collection shortcut menu available when your jBoard is displayed. 
- Tools shortcut menu: a default bookmark list of applications such as Jujue, Google Meet, Miro (online whiteboard), and HackMD. 
- QRCode: opens a touch panel application on mobile phone devices that can be used to navigate between jBoard pages.
- Collection shortcut menu: quick access to other jBoards. jBoards can be grouped together in a Collection.
