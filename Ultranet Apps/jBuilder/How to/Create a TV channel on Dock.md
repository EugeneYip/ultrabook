### Create a TV Channel on Dock
A jBoard TV channel is a dock page with a playlist collection of Youtube Videos.
1. Add a new dock page, assigning its title and icons like usual.
2. Select the `As Tv Channel` checkbox. 
3. Click `Add Channel`.

4. Assign a title to the video. (This title will only be visible in jBuilder Dock Builder)
5. 
* Enter the Youtube video URL to the `Url` Field. Various Youtube URL formats are all accepted, such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID or https://youtu.be/VIDEOID. <br> 
* However, please note that functions such as specific start/end time in the URL will not be available.<br> Any link such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID&t=TIMESTAMP or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID&list=PlaylistID etc.<br> Will simply be shown on the jBoard as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID. <br> 
* If you wish to include a playlist (that will autoplay by default), use the link for the complete playlist, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PlaylistID. 

7. Leave the `Use thumbnail` checkbox as the default setting, or unselect the checkbox and use the `Icon Url` field to replace the video thumbnail with an image of your choice. 
8. Repeat steps 3-6 as many times as desired. 
9. Hit Confirm after you are done.
- Note: Disregard the `Autoplay` checkbox. This option is now available in jBoard Settings for each viewer to change (rather than just the jBoard creator).
