## The Basics
### What is a jBoard
With jBuilder you can create jBoards that can be used as digital display boards or digital dashboards.

A jBoard consists of a series of individual boards combined on a dock menu, each having their own dock page. 

You can navigate between dock pages from the dock menu at the bottom of a jBoard. 

Example of an indivudal board created with jBuilder:

### jBuilder and Dock Builder
There are two main work areas involved in jBuilder. <br>
In the default jBuilder work area you create individual boards, then move on to the Dock Builder work area to combine a series of boards to create a complete jBoard.

### How to access Dock Builder: 
From the default jBuilder work area, click on the <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BwmKrTz.png" width=33 height=30> icon on the top left hand corner to go to Dock Builder. <br>
To leave Dock Builder and return to jBuilder, click the <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HopFYkU.png" width=35 height=30> icon. 

### jBuilder Work Area UI
On the left hand side <img src="https://i.imgur.com/66dK5wO.png" width=30 height=30> sidebar, the user can define the board grid by specifying the number of columns and rows, as well as enable/disable the header and footer of the board frame. 
The board grid serves as the framework for the board’s layout and helps us manage the proportions between elements for responsive web design. 

Next to this on the top tool bar, is <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BwmKrTz.png" width=33 height=30> which leads to Dock Builder. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fuglHd7.png" width=760 height=475>

The icons at the right of the top tool bar have the following functions:
* Save board <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TJUZUG1.png" width=35 height=30>
* Add new panel <img src="https://i.imgur.com/J4a1Laa.png" width=30 height=30>

### Dock Builder UI
In the top left corner, the <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HopFYkU.png" width=35 height=30> icon on the tool bar leads back to the default jBuilder work area.

Icons at the right of the top tool bar have the following functions: 
* Save jBoard <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TJUZUG1.png" width=35 height=30>
* Open jBoard library list <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BwmKrTz.png" width=33 height=30>

Below the tool bar, at the top of the work area is the header. There is no header by default, but if you wish to add one, click <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6biIEa1.png" width=31 height=30> to edit.
