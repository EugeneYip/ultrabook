# Twin Clocking
Clouder interns are usually requested to set up a clock-in flow on fBuilder. The main purpose of clocking in is not to check if you arrive on time to work. Itâ€™s to test the qrun system, and make it is easier for the maintainer at YPCloud to identify bugs and make improvements. 

You should clock in 4 times a day: 00:00, 09:00, 12:00, and 18:00. 
If you are asked to clock in, follow these steps: 

* Click on <img src="https://i.imgur.com/66dK5wO.png" width=20 height=20> button in the top right corner and select "Create Project"
