# Parallel instances of SmartScreen
Steps to install and enable running multiple browsers of SmartScreen at the same time:

`$ sudo snap set system experimental.parallel-instances=true `

`$ sudo snap download smartscreen` 

Note what revision of smartscreen has been installed: e.g. `snap install smartscreen_18.snap`, `snap install smartscreen_30.snap`, etc. 

Next:

`$ sudo snap install --dangerous --name smartscreen_s1 ./smartscreen_18.snap `

- Substitute `smartscreen_s1` with the name of your choice. For ease of use, it is recommended that you follow the general general pattern of "smartscreen_s1", "smartscreen_s2", "smartscreen_s3" etc.
- Substitute `smartscreen_18.snap` with the name of the SmartScreen revision installed in the previous command line. 

Repeat this step for as many copies of SmartScreen you need.
